# boca-status-readout

## What's this?

It's a helper binary/lib to gather maintenance data from boca printer. It crawls the web interface of the printer instead of using snmp. Maybe serial/usb status gathering will be added later

## Stability

Should be stable enough(even has some tests!!11) - use at your own risk
